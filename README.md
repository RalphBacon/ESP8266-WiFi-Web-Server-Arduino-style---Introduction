# ESP8266 WiFi Web Server Arduino-style - Introduction
Getting started with an Arduino-style ESP8266 WiFi board to control your environment

Using an ESP8266-based, Arduino-sized board for WiFi control of your environment is a great way to get into remote control, data-logging and so on.

Read the temperature of your greenhouse; turn on a fan in your home from your browser in the office... the possibilities are endless. All with a few lines of C++ code and a smattering of HTML (very easy).

This is just a quick(ish) intro into the world of WiFi control - I'll think of a Real World project in the near(is) future - unless you have some ideas? Drop them into the comments section below.

All PDFs and other links on how to set up these great boards can be found in the comments section below, including where I procured these devices.

The demo sketch can be found here in this repository (ESP8266_WiFi_Simple.ino)

To get you going there are also two PDFs that describe the boards in the video and the installation process.

As always, Thanks for Watching and do subscribe so you don't miss future videos that will help you get your project off the ground.
